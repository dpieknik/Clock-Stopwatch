<h1>Clock & Stopwatch</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This program creates a clock and stopwatch displaying them both. The clock pulls current time and the stopwatch
is designed to end instances before starting new ones in order to stop race conditions. Start, Stop, and Reset
function as expected. The clock.js file is the primary part of this work. A few lines of HTML had to be adjusted 
due to some missing pieces.
